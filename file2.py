# /////////// INSTRUCTIONS /////////////////
# 💻 Run this file with the "Run ▶" button️
#      (you will need to type your favorite food into below)

# 🐞 This program has a bug! That's just a fancy computer science word for error.

# 👀 Pay close attention to the order of the code!

# 💻 It is your job to fix the bug!
#    - why does the first print statement in line 21 work?
#    - remember, the order of instructions is important

# 💡 \n creates a new line, it's like clicking the 'return' button in Google Docs

# ⏭ Go story.py when you are finished!
