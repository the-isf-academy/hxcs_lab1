# /////////// INSTRUCTIONS /////////////////

# 💻 Run this file with the "Run ▶" button️

# 💻 Write code that makes your computer print out a customizable story!

# Feel free to change the story however you'd like - as long as it's school appropriate :)

# ✔️ Your code should:
#    - use 3-5 different variables with user input
#    - use at least one of those variables multiple times

# 🤔 As you're deciding what to code, make sure to think about the following things:
#    - How can the message I write make use of variables?
#    - For example, the creature they encounter

# 👋 When you're finished, share your program with a friend!
